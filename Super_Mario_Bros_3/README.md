Most if not all of these patches work on Super Mario Bros 3 romhacks, as well.

all items
---------

`Super Mario Bros 3 all items.ips` begins all runs with maxed inventory, similar
to debug mode. They ARE single use consumption (another patch should exist later
to permanently enable them).

noauto
------

Remove autoscrollers from the game

nocards
-------

`Super Mario Bros 3 nocards.ips` removes all random card encounters, normally
triggered every time a players score passes a multiple of 80000.

It works by patching around $AC9D. There is a check for coins, and we change
the BCC to immediately RTS (NOP,NOP) instead of whatever branched lameness
normally occurred.

nodeath
-------

`Super Mario Bros 3 nodeath.ips` removes decrement of lives upon enemy death.

nohands
-------

`Super Mario Bros 3 nohands.ips` removes the random hands in world 8 to
give the runner more consistent runs. For practice, a player may still manually
click on the hand to enter a world.

quickdeath
----------

`Super Mario Bros 3 quickdeath.ips` makes Mario's death very quick, so one
may practice and learn much faster, or make a romhack faster to go through.

skip levels
-----------
`Super Mario Bros 3 skip levels.ips` allows for overworld movement over uncompleted
levels.

title
-----------
`Super Mario Bros 3 title.ips` rounded s on title screen :D
